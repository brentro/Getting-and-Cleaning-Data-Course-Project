## Class Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

The class project for Getting and Cleaning Data was to read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

** Before running the R script:**

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the file.
3. Set the working directory to the unzipped folder "UCI HAR Dataset"
4. Download the [reshape2 package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html), from CRAN

The output of the R script is a CSV file called **tidy**

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the Code Book.
